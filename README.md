learning the things

I've worked in the coffee industry since 2000, mostly in retail cafes, but also as a coffee educator. 
This whole covid business has shaken up an already meager existence, and I would like to add skills to my arsenal
that will help put me on more solid ground to be able to take care of myself and my family better. Hence the attempt to learn 
code stuff. At this point, I've only spent a couple months figuring out HTML5 and CSS3, and a teensy bit of JavaScript. Mostly through tutorials such as 
freecodecamp.org and a 10 hour video on Youtube over HTML5 and CSS. I have a couple books too, so once I wrap my mind around front end stuff a little more, it'll be on to Python.
